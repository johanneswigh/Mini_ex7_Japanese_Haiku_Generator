Try out the program! OBS: The text shows up after a few seconds, be patient https://rawgit.com/MathiasTvilling/Mini_ex7_Japanese_Haiku_Generator/master/Japanese_Haiku_Generator/empty-example/index.html

Description of program: 
This programs intended use was to generate Haiku. We found a lot of famous haiku poems, and made the program generate each line, so an unique poem is created every time. On top of that we included a background picture of mount Fuji, while ‘’sterotypical’’ Japanese music is playing. We implemented a new font, to give the text a more personal touch. 

We recomend to spend at least a minute to se the different poems created.

We wanted to implement sound which would read the poem which was generated, but after an incredible time trying to do this, we finally gave up. We have left the code in the program, if the reader of this ReadME wants to see where it went wrong. Everyone is welcome to have a go at solving the problem. All sound files are available in the "quotes" folder.
